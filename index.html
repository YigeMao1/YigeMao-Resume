        <p class="lead mb-4">A third-year student in University of California, riverside, majoring in Business Administration with a concentration on marketing. Have a strong theory-based marketing and related business problem solving skill to accommodate himself in any working environment. Passionate on fashion industry with advanced sense of art and is always able to find the up-to-date changes on aesthetics of many types of style among American population. Multiple languages spoken enable him to communicate between cultures and combine their theory onto a better understanding on fashion.<br><br>

        I received an associate degree on business administration major at College of San Mateo, and currently enrolled in University of California, Riverside, majoring in Business Administration with a concentration on marketing. I expect to earn my bachelorâ€™s degree by the summer in 2023. Additionally, I fluently speak Chinese Mandarin and English as well as medium level of Cantonese, and am an expert in frequently used software, Microsoft Office for example. During my four years of studying in business area, I acquired all the basic business-related knowledges that will support my success on my future career, and I will keep rising my professional skills by taking advantages from the last two years of study at UCR and my future workplace. <br><br>

        In my role as an international student ambassador at College of San Mateo, I had a chance to prove myself to be an efficient and enthusiastic communicator. I helped more than 20 students with their full enrollment and registration processes, and I was always available to any students who was facing difficulty on their lives on the US. Depend on their feedback by the end of semester, most of students who I worked with found that my assistance significantly increased their happiness and academic performance and expressed their appreciation to my help. 
        
        After graduation from college and transferring to University of California, Riverside, I never stopped taking chances to join organizations where I can contribute my time and skills to help others as well as gain more professional experience. I had my interview with CSSA(The Chinese Students and Scholars Association, a non-profit organization with more than 100 members and licensed by UCR official) at the first week of this academic quarter and become one of 50 admitted members among more than 100 applicants based on my strong business communication skills. Last week my team just successfully accomplished our first project of this quarter to conduct a meeting and dinner for new students of UCR, within approximately 300 students present. What my team mainly did was communicating with a new sponsor for partial cost coverage for exchange of ad space during our event. The sponsor was very satisfied with the ideas that we present to them, and we finally had a great conversation and made this business cooperation succeed.
